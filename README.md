# StudyBuddy

## Philosophy  

This app was primarily built as a learning project rather than for real-world use. The goal was to practice database queries, implement CRUD operations, and develop a fully functional web application using Django—all while maintaining a polished and stylish design.  

To achieve this, the app was designed as an interactive platform featuring multiple rooms, discussion threads, and activity tracking.  

## Description  

The app allows users to engage in discussions by creating and joining chat rooms categorized by topics. It provides a dynamic and interactive space for users to connect and participate in conversations.  

### Key Features:  

- **User Authentication** – Sign up, log in, and upload profile pictures.  
- **Chat Rooms** – Create and join rooms based on various topics.  
- **Discussion Threads** – Engage in threaded conversations within rooms.  
- **Activity Feed** – View a personalized feed of recent activities.  
- **Participant Tracking** – See the number of users in each room at a glance.  
- **Categorized Topics** – Browse rooms organized by relevant subjects.  

This project serves as a practical exercise in building a social discussion platform while refining skills in Django, database management, and frontend styling.
